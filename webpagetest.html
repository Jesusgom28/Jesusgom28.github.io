	</head>
		<body>
			<h1 id="top">this is a web page</h1>
			<a href="#text_and_their_shortcuts">text and their shortcuts</a><br />
			<a href="#list">list</a><br />
			<a href="#links">links</a><br />

			<p>this will show what I can do on an html file</p>
			<h2>this is the sub heading</h2>
			<p>this will just help with the flow of the web page</p>
			<p> headers are listed as h1, h2, h3, and so on and so forth with each one they will
			be smaller for example</p>
			<h1>h1</h1>
			<h2>h2</h2>
			<h3>h3</h3>
			<h4>h4</h4>
			<h3>h5</h5>
			<p>those show that they headers will get smaller depending on the web site you should use
			these</p>
			<h2 id="text_and_their_shortcuts">text and their shortcuts</h2>
			<p>the next thing is <b>bold letters</b> which is the letter "b" <br />
			to make words <i>italic</i> all that is need is a letter "i"<br />
			to make number rooted its easy 2<sup>2</sup>=4 just use "sup"<br />
			now I can talk about white spacing which is something that I should use it just leaving white
			spaces in the code so that it is easier to make changes and when I need to I'll use it in
			the code,        using it will not make the spacing in the web page because it will correct itself<br />
			now I have already been using breaks in this paragraph just by using "br /"<br />
			now to creat breaks between topics you can us "hr /" and it will creat a line to change topics will be used after the topic change I will continue on with text and their shortcuts</p>
			<p>while I don't see a difference between strong and bold <strong>strong</strong> is seen as a separate thing<br />
			not to add <em>emphasis</em> which I also see no difference in italic and emphasis the look the same to they are different<br /></p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/"><p>while I'm supposed to like to like a wiki for the quote im just lazy to look for the quotes
			so blockquote are used for quotes that are too long</p></blockquote>
			<p>for shorter quotes it just the letter "p" for example <q>I think it is easier to just use shorter quotes</q><br />
			to abbreviate something you need to use "abbr" for example <abbr title="professor">prof</abbr> that's a good way to abbreviate<br />
			now I have already used "cite" in some of the other code im using but ciiting is used for books and articles it used
			to show what is important like <cite>a brief history of time</cite> by stephen hawking is something that I would use<br />
			now to <dfn>define</dfn> somehing I would use "dfn"  it should show in italic<br />
			for addresses and email I would do the following check the code to lazy to write about it<br />
			<address>
				<p><a href="mailto:jesusgomezm9728@gmail.com">jesusgomezm9728@gmail</a></P>
				<p>2672 queen st.</p>
			</address>
			this part is used to delete and insert words in the sentence structure for example "this is the <del>best</del> <ins>worst</ins> sentence ever"<br />
			to show something that is not relevent any more insead of using the "del" you would use "s" for example <s>blah</s> it is not relevent to what I'm saying</p><hr />
			<h2 id="list">list</h2>
			<p>this section will focus on the ordered list, unordered list, and defining words and it goes as follows <br />
			<ol>
				<li>ordered list are numbered as there is no limmit to the numbers you need</li>
				<li>list can also have sub list</li>
					<ol>
						<li>this is the sub list</li>
						<li>this is better used when making a cooking web site but I can use it for other stuff</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li>this is the unordered list</li>
				<li>this one can also have a sub list</li>
					<ul>
						<li>the sub list for this one is much nicer</li>
						<li>the unordered list is my favorite</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<dl>
				<dt>dl</dt>
				<dd>dl is used to create definition list in side the deffiniton list you will use "dt"which contains the term that will be defined<br />
				"dd" is used to define the word</dd>
				<dt>tommorow</dt>
				<dd>tommorow will never come it will always be out of reach</dd>
			that is the last of the list section</p><hr />
			<h2 id="links">links</h2>
			<p>this section will be on linking to other web sites and linking to specific parts of the web page</p>
			<p>links to other sites are used by putting the letter "a" for example lets link google <a href="https://www.google.com/">google</a><br />
			linking to other pages on the same site is a little different you need to make sure that they are located within the same site<br />
			<a href="file:///C:/Users/jgome/Desktop/test%20page/web%20page%20test.html">home</a> if I had a differnt site it would proably work better<br />
			now I sometimes see the mail us to find out more the way they do that is by using "mailto:" for example <a href="mailto:jesusgomezm9728@gmail">email jesus</a>
			this will only work if the mail is connected to the browser or your computer<br />
			now lets say I want to link to my YouTube channel I would want to link it to a new tab I would use the "target=_blank" to link it<br />
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (opens YouTube in a new tab)<br />
			<a href="#top">top</a></p><br />
			when linking to the website you need to make sure that you have the links conneced with the right words and ids<hr />
			<h2 id="images">images</h2>
			<p>images for me are very difficult to apply I always feel like I'm doing it wrong</p>
			<img src="images/escape.png" alt="escape by Journey" title="escape" />
			<img src="images/escape.png" alt="escape by Journey" width="100" height="100" />
			<p>I never seem to get images to work but the thing is I must try to get it to work and I will make sure it does but first <br />
			I need to explain a few things when putting in an images you have to make sure it belongs in the website folder so that when it<br />
			looks for the images it knows where to go so to search for the image you would need to put "src" that will search for the imagae<br />
			if the image does not show you would need to put an alternative or "alt" to the images so the name of what the image is when you visit <br />
			a different web site and hover over an images it gives you the name of that images that would be the title and you would use "title" <br />
			"height" and "width" are obviously used to make sure the images is just the right size to make it work for images you need to make sure <br />
			where you want the image depending where you put the line of code you need to put it in the right location aligning the image this is part of old code so <br />
			depending on which html you are using you should and shouldn't use it but if you want to use it this would be an example<br />
			"img src="images/escape.jpg alt="escape by Journey" Width="100" height="100" align="left"" that would be an example also insead of "left" you can use "right",<br />
			"top","middle", or "bottom" besides all that there are different forms of image formats for example you have the standard ".jpg" but you also have <br />
			".gif" also dealing with edding photos make sure you know its pixle dimensions and if croping make sure you crop unnessesary details <br />
			you also pixle and its resolution but a better nonitor can change anything vector images are created in adobe animated gif are basically small videos<br />
			some web sites I have seen have had transparency images showing one image then hovering over it to show another downloading and saving images are something every one know how to do<br />
			for html5 you would use "figure" and "figcaption" inspect element to see code<br />
			<figure>
				<img src="images/escape.jpg" alt="escape by Journey" />
				<br />
				<figcaption>escape one of the best Journey albums I have heard</figcaption>
			</figure>
			that is the end to the images section</p><hr />
			<h2 id="tables">tables</h2>
			<P>tables they will be used to desplay information that one can use to show sales or for a simple data structure
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>15</td>
					<td>15</td>
					<td>30</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>45</td>
					<td>60</td>
					<td>45</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>60</td>
					<td>90</td>
					<td>90</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			this table was used with "table" to create the table "tr" is used to start a new row it also stands for table row(tr)<br />
			cells of the table where used with "td" and that stands for table data that one table this is the other one<br />
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th scope="col">saturday</th>
					<th scope="col">sunday</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th scope="row">tickets sold:</th>
					<td>120</td>
					<td>135</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th scope="row">total sale:</th>
					<td>$600</th>
					<td>$675</th>
				</tr>
			</table>
			a different element is used other than the "td" it would be the "th" which stands for table heading this is used when the cell has content that needs to be displayed <br />
			when you don't want it to represent anything you can use "td" with css "th" has greater value the next table will hold a timetable so it have a new element added<br />
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>9am</th>
					<th>10am</th>
					<th>11am</th>
					<th>12am</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>monday</th>
					<td colspan="2">geography</td>
					<td>math</td>
					<td>art</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>tuesday</th>
					<td colspan="3">gym</td>
					<td>home ec</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			by using "colspan="2"" tells the cell to run across 2 collums the other cells take the collum that they are given without using "colspan" it does tell it to take more than one collum<br />
			<!--css should be able to add an outline for the table so return to this once you are in that section-->
			this other table will cover the spanning rows
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>abc</th>
					<th>bbc</th>
					<th>cnn</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>6pm - 7pm</th>
					<td rowspan="2">movie</td>
					<td>comedy</td>
					<td>news</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>7pm - 8pm</th>
					<td>sports</td>
					<td>current affairs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<!--again more can be added through css-->
			this row shows that you can extend the content to take the top and bottom row this table is used to hold larger tables
			<table>
				<thead>the correct way to use (<!--thead-->)</thead>
					<tr>
						<th>date</th>
						<th>income</th>
						<th>expenditure</th>
					</tr>
					 not how to use it (<!--</thead>-->)
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>1st january</th>
						<td>250</td>
						<td>36</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>2nd january</th>
						<td>285</td>
						<td>48</td>
					</tr>
					<!--additional rows as above-->
					<tr>
						<th>31st january</th>
						<td>129</th>
						<td>64</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
				<tfoot>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>7882</td>
						<td>1254</td>
					</tr>
				</tfoot>
				</table>
				with my lazy ness I didn't feel like making the rest but now to explain while the book doesn't give the best explantion the "thead" element is used so that the table can fit inside it<br />
				the "tbody" element is used so that the body can fit in the table and the "tfoot" can fit inside the footer more can be added with css also the reason that the "thead" and "tfoot"<br />
				are separate, is so that the browser can keep it them both visable then when printed these last 2 table will deal with old code and spcaing
				<table width="400" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5">
					<tr>
						<th width="150"></th>
						<th>withdrawn</th>
						<th>credit</th>
						<th width="150">balance</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>january</th>
						<td>250.00</th>
						<td>660.00</th>
						<td>410.50</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>february</th>
						<td>135.55</td>
						<td>895.20</td>
						<td>1170.15</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				this is the first table some of the atributes here are not supported by new websites making it not work while it works on crome it may not work on mobile or on other platforms<br />
				most of it has been replaced with css however it still is valuable to learn this table will add a border and a background to the table
				<table border="2" bgcolor="#efefef">
					<tr>
						<th width="150"></th>
						<th>withdrawn</th>
						<th>credit</th>
						<th width="150" bgcolor="#cccccc">balance</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>january</th>
						<td>250.00</td>
						<td>660.50</td>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">410.50</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>february</th>
						<td>135.55</td>
						<td>895.20</td>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">1170.15</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				again while it does work on chrome with css it could be used on any device but with the attributes "border" and adding the "width" to the table also makes it look the way it looks <br />
				and adding color with "bgcolor" color for html is a 5-6 letter and number combination will go over later</p><hr />
				<h2 id="forms">forms</h2>
				<p>most websites have forms that one can fill out to register their email or fill out an application it will also help with gathering information adn collecting data on a server<br />
				<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
				<p>this is where the form controls will appear</p>
				</form>
				this form had 3 different elements that make it work first is "form" it should always have and action attribute, method and id attribute<br />
				the "action" attribute will have the url for the page on the server that will recive the information submitted<br />
				the "method" attribute the forms can be sent weith "get" or "post" with the get method are used at the end of the ulr and are commonly used on search boxes or retrieving data<br />
				the post method the values are sent as http headers and theys should be used when users want to upload data, very long text, contains sensitive data, and add or deletes information<br />
				the "id" are used to identify the form distincly form other elemtns on the page now on to a new form
				<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
					<p>username
						<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
					</P>
				</form>
				this text imput is created by using the "input" attribute it is used to create different forms of controls the value of the type determines what kind of input it will be creating<br />
				the "type="text"" will create a single line text input<br />
				the "name" is information that will allow the server to know what data is being used that is why each control requires a name attribute<br />
				"size" will always make it a box to put text in but can be expanded in css<br />
				"maxlength" will limit the number of characters a user may enter in the text field<br />
				<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
					<p>username:
						<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
					</P>
					<p>password:
						<input type="password" name="password" size="15" maxlength="30" />
					</p>
				</form>
				the "type" attribute has many forms one form is the "password" and they work the same as the "username"<br />
				this form will have a text box 
				<form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
					<p>what did you think of thkis gig?</p>
						<textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">enter your comments...</textarea>
				</form>
				the "textarea" element is used to create multi-line text imput and unlike the other input elements this is not an empty elemnet it should have an opening anc closing tag<br />
				css can add more features to it will add css later of course this is an option form
				<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
					<p>please select your favorite genre:</p>
						<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" /> rock
						<input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" /> pop
						<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" /> jazz
					</P>
				</form>
				this is a form that gives options to choose from using the "type="radio"" makes it a button to choose one from different options the "name="genre"" should all be the same<br />
				because it is in the same catergory the "value" attribue will send the information to the server to record data "checked" should load with one already selected only one in<br />
				in the radio button should be used not on all the options also the option already selected cannot be deselected if you are only allowing one to be selected the next form will allow it
				<form action="http://www.example.com/profile/php">
					<p>please select your favorite music service(s)<br />
					<input type="checkbox" name="services" value="itunes" checked="checked" /> itunes
					<input type="checkbox" name="services" value="lastfm" /> last.fm
					<input type="checkbox" name="services" value="spotify" /> spotify
					</p>
				</form>
				this form is the checkbox form insead of the a circle it is a box that can be checked and unchecked next is the drop down list
				<form action="www.example.com/profile.php">
					<p>what device do you listen to music on?</p>
						<select name="devices">
							<option value="ipod">ipod</option>
							<option value="radio">radio</option>
							<option value="computer">computer</option>
						</select>
				</form>
				this is a drop down list box it allows the user to select one of the options available the "select" element is used to create this box it is used when it contains more than one <br />
				"option" element the rest is the same as the other forms this next box is for multiple selections 
				<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
					<p>do you play any of the following instruments?<br />
					(you can select more than one option by holding down control on a pc or command keyon a mac while selecting different options.)</p>
						<select name="instruments" size="3" multiple="multiple">
							<option value="guitar" selected="selected">guitar</option>
							<option value="drums">drums</option>
							<option value="keyboard" selected="selected">keyboard</option>
							<option value="bass">bass</option>
						</select>
				</form>
				the multiple select box use "multiple" attribute allows users to select more than one of the options available the next form will allow file upload
				<form action="http://www.example.com/upload/php" method="post">
					<p>upload your song in mp3 format:</p>
					<input type="file" name="user-song" /><br />
					<input type="submit" value="upload" />
				</form>
				this form is amazing it not only allows the user to look for files from their directory it will also help upload them by using "type-file" it creates a box that can be used to look for files<br />
				by clicking the button it should bring up the file directory on their computer allow them to upload it to the site next will be the submit form
				<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php">
					<p>subscribe to our email list:</p>
						<input type="text" name="email" />
						<input type="submit" name="subscribe" value="subscribe" />
				</form>
				for this form the "type="submit"" is what is used to submit a form to the servers "name" and "value" name used to name it but doesn't need one and value used to to control the text above<br />
				this form will be for images
				<form action="http://www.example.org/subscibe.php">
					<p>subscribe to our email list:</p>
						<input type="text" name="email" />
						<input type="image" src="images/subscribe.jpg" width="100" height="20" />
				</form>
				not much to this form very simple "type="image" is used 
				<form action="http://www.example.com/add.php">
					<button><img src="images/add.gif" alt="add" width="10" height="10" /> add</button>
					<input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />
				</form>
				the "button" element is used to allow the users more control over how the button appears you can combine images inside the opening and the closing of the "button" tag<br /> 
				the "hidden" attribute make it so that the form controls are not shown but they do allow th page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see for example <br />
				a page author can use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form
				<label>age: <input type="text" name="age" /></label><br />
				gender:
				<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f">
				<label for="female">female</label>
				<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" value="m">
				<label for="male">male</label>
				this is called a labelling form the control was kept simple by indication the putpose of each one in text next to it however it should have its own "lable" element makes it easier for those <br />
				with vison imparments. the "lable" element can be used in 2 ways 
				<ol>
					<li>wrap around both text description and the form input</li>
					<li>be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control it is a lable for</li>
				</ol>
				the for attribute states which form control the lable belongs to note how the radio buttons use the id attribute the value of the id attribute uniquely identifies an element<br />
				from all other elements on a page the value of the for attribute matches tthat of the id attribute on the from control it is labelling it also expands the the clickable area for the the user
				<fieldset>
					<legend>contact details</legend>
					<label>email:<br />
					<input type="text" name="email" /></label><br />
					<label>mobile:<br />
					<input type="text" name="moblie" /></label><br />
					<label>telephone:<br />
					<input type="text" name="moblie" /></label>
				</fieldset>
				you can group related form controls togetherinside the "fieldset" element this is usefull for longer forms most browsers will show the fieldset with a line around the edge <br />
				the lines can be changed with css the "legend" element can come directly after the opening "fieldset" tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group
				instead of using javascript I will use a HTML5 coding for this next forms
				<form action="http://www.example.com/login/" method="post">
					<label for="username">username:</label>
					<input type="text" name="username" required="required" /><br />
					<label for="password">password:</label>
					<input type="password" name="password" required="required" />
					<input type="submit" value="submit" />
				</form>
				while the code does not show on this site I will link to the other site that is html5 and over there will have the explation
				<a herf="file:///C:/Users/jgome/Desktop/test%20page/web%20page%20test.html#forms">html5 site</a>
